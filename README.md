# Problem
I want to be able to style the cells based on the value of the cell. For example 'Y' = Green and 'N' = Red.

I've ran a few tests based on the following examples:

https://codesandbox.io/s/744n0nmvl0?file=/index.js:570-571 

And then I also tried the below, but I looked and react-table doesn't seem to have a style sheet so this might be outdated? Not sure.
